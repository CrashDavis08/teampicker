### Hey Adam!


## Changelog
#### (List significant changes to the capsule, and increase the version with each one)

#### 0.1.0
- initial commit


## TODO
- Change capsule name to eviladam.?????
- Put players in dev center? Or use a DB to store stats and fetch them from ConstructPlayerList. Either way, it would be better to do this than have their names/ratings in a public github repo
- Think about using win percentage instead of player impact, and updating with every game
- If we want to submit this to the marketplace, we should find a way to have a passcode/secret entry way, so only viv people can use it (at least while our players are hard coded into the capsule)
- If we do submit this to the marketplace, we can eventually enable this capsule for the `bixby-watch-en-US` target, and someone can make the teams out on the field using their galaxy watch
- Consider the tentative player feature; i.e. if teams are made and we suspect someone might show up late, we could tell the capsule who we think might show up late (maybe with a conversation driver), and have it tell us the easiest AND fairest way to edit the teams (who to swap) once they show up.
